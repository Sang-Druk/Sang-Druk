              <strong className="text-foreground">Sang-Druk Tibetan Herbal Clinic</strong> is Indore's first dedicated centre for the ancient science of <strong className="text-foreground">Sowa Rigpa (Traditional Tibetan Medicine)</strong>. We are honoured to bring the profound healing wisdom of the Himalayas to the heart of India - Madhya Pradesh — marking a meaningful step in sharing this 2,500-year-old medical tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rooted in the principles of balance, prevention, and holistic wellness, Sowa Rigpa focuses on harmonizing the body’s three vital energies—Lung (Wind), Tripa (Bile), and Beken (Phlegm)—to restore health, prevent disease, and promote long-lasting well-being. Rather than treating only symptoms, Tibetan Medicine addresses the root cause of illness through personalized diagnosis and natural healing methods
            </p>
            <p>
              The preservation and development of Tibetan Medicine in India gained remarkable strength in 1961 when His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama founded <strong className="text-foreground">Men-Tsee-Khang</strong> (The Tibetan Medical and Astro Institute).  This institution was established to preserve, promote, and practice Tibetan Medicine and Astrology while improving public health, awareness, and accessible healthcare for all—regardless of caste, creed, or color.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuing this rich and compassionate tradition, Sang-Dr̈uk Tibetan Herbal Clinic proudly brings authentic Tibetan healing to Indore, Madhya Pradesh, serving as one of Central India’s pioneering centers for Sowa Rigpa and traditional Tibetan healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to offer safe, natural, and personalized treatment through the timeless wisdom of Tibetan medicine—helping every patient achieve true balance, health, and harmony             </p>
